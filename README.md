Designed a diagnostic system utilizing Gaussian Wavelet Transforms, STFT, and matrix invariants from scalograms for feature extraction from chest X-ray images, enhancing the detection of diseases like Pneumonia, COVID-19, and Asthma. A novel Smith Normal Form (SNF) feature extraction method was proposed using a sliding window, where a 32×32 X-ray image is divided into overlapping 5×5 submatrices. Also proposed is a LeNet-5 architecture followed by a dense MLP network with three layers (1054, 512, 256 neurons), incorporating ReLU activation, batch normalization, and a 0.5 dropout rate to improve generalization.
